Swan language
================================================================================

`Swan` is a simple yet powerful expression language with functional flavor.
It is written in Javascript and it runs both in NodeJS and in the browse.

An expression is a sequence of binary operations 
(operand operator operand operator operand ...), eventually grouped with 
parenthesis (...), square braces [...] or curly braces {...}.

For example, the following expression will resolve to `14`.

```
12 + 2 * 3 - 4
```


Boolean data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `TRUE` and `FALSE` names are predefined in the global namespace and
map to the two boolean values.


Numeric data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of valid numeric literals are:
* `10`
* `3.14`
* `-2.5e3`


String data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A string is any sequence of characters, enclosed between one of the following
two types of quotes:

* `"double quotes string"`
* `'single quotes string'`
* `` `accent quotes string` ``

A string within accent quotes is a template string: expression eventually
enclosed between `${` and `}` get evaluated and replaced. For example, the
expression `` `2*10 = ${2*10}` `` returns the string `2*10 = 20`.


Tuple data type and pairing operator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuples are an ordered sequence of values. They are created using the comma 
operator `,`. The following example shows a tuple made of three items: `1`, `2` 
and `"abc"`

```
1, 2, "abc"
```

Tuples can contain any other data type as items, except tuples itself. If you
try to create a tuple of tuples, you get a flattened tuple as result: 
`(1,2),(3,4),5` is equivalent to `1,2,3,4,5`.

Any value in swan (e.g. `10` or `"abc"` or a list, etc.) is also seen as a
tuple made of only one item.

A special type of tuple is the empty tuple `()` which is used in swan to 
represent the concept of nothingness.


List data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A list is an ordered sequence of values, just like a tuple, but it behaves
like a single value (uni-dimensional tuple). For this reason, it allows 
nesting and behaves differently from tuples.

A list is created as `[tuple]`. Examples of valid list literals are:
* `[1,2,"abc"]` list with three elements
* `[1]` list with only one element
* `[]` empty list
* `[[1,2],[3,4,5]]` list of lists


Assignment operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The assignment operator binds a name to an expression value:

```
x = 10 + 1
```

After this expression, the context will contain a name `x` with associated 
value `11`. After defining `x` we can reuse it as follows:

```
x * 2
```

which will resolve to `22`.

Valid names can contain letters (`a..z` and `A..Z`), numbers (`0..9`) and the
underscore character (`_`), but they cannot start with a numeric character.

Every expression has a return value; in particular an assignment expression
`x = 10` returns nothing (the empty tuple in swan, equivalent to `null` in
JavaScript). 

Multiple values (a tuple of values) can be assigned to multiple names (a tuple 
of names) as follows:

```
(a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)
```

After this expression, `a` will hold the value `1`, `b` will hold the value `2`
and `c` will hold the value `3`.

If the tuple of values contains less items than the tuple of names, the exceeding
names will be assigned nothing (empty tuple): `(a,b,c,d) = (1,2)` will result in
`a=1`, `b=2`, `c=()` and `d=()`.

If the tuple of values contains more items than the tuple of names, the last name
will be assigned the tuple of the remaining values: `(a,b,c) = (1,2,3,4,5)` will
result in `a=1`, `b=2` and `c=(3,4,5)`.


Labeling operator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The labelling operator `:` works exactly as the assignment operator `=`, with
the only exception that the operation returns the right-hand value instead of
`Nothing`. For example, the following expression binds `11` to `x` and returns
`11`.

`x: 10 + 1`


Namespace data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A namespace is a set of name-value pairs defined as `{tuple}`.

```
{
    x = 10,
    y = 20,
    z = 30
}
```

We basically assigned three values to three names, but those names are not 
available in the global context, but wrapped in the namespace object instead.

In order to access the names inside a namespace, you can use either the 
application operator ` ` or the subcontexting operator `.`. We will explain 
these operators later, but some examples are anticipated below:

* `ns = {a=1, b=2, c=3}` defines a namespace and maps it to the name `ns`
* `ns.a` resolves to `1`
* `ns('b')` resolves to `2`


Function data type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A function is a parametric expression, defined as `names -> expression`.
For example:

```
(x,y) -> x+y
```

defines a function that takes two parameters `x` and `y` as input and produces
their sum as output.

In order to execute a function, we use the application operator (void operator), 
which will be introduced later, but some examples are anticipated below:

* `f = x -> 2*x` defines a function that takes one parameter and doubles it
* `f 4` resolves to `8`
* `f(5)` resolves to `10`


Application operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A missing operator (two operands next to each other: `F X`), defines an 
application operation: `F` applied to `X`.

**When F is a function**, the application operation corresponds to a function 
call. Given a function `f: x -> 2*x`, the expression `f 5` is an application
operation (`f` applied to `5`) that resolves to `10`.

Since the expression `(5)` is equivalent to the expression `5`, you could also 
write the application operation in the more familiar form `f(5)`.

When the function parameter `x` is a tuple (e.g. `f: (x,y) -> x+y`), the 
application will look like `f(x,y)`. In this case the parenthesis are necessary, 
because `f x,y` would resolve to the tuple `(f x), y` instead.

Notice that assigning parameter values to tuple arguments works the same as 
tuple-values to tuple-names assignment:

* in `((x,y,z)->x+y+z)(1,2)` the parameter `x` will be `1`, the parameter `y` 
  will be `2` and the parameter `z` will be `()`
* in `((x,y)->x+y)(1,2,3)` the parameter `x` will be `1` and the parameter `y` 
  will be the `2,3` tuple

**When F is a list and X is a number**, the application `F X` returns the list 
item at position X. To understand this behavior, think at a list as a function 
that maps natural numbers to values.

Examples:
* `['a','b','c'] 0` will return `'a'`
* `['a','b','c'] (1)` will return `'b'`
* `['a','b','c'](2)` will return `'c'`

If X is a negative number, it will be interpreted as relative to the end of the
list:

* `['a','b','c'](-1)` will return `'c'`
* `['a','b','c'](-2)` will return `'b'`
* `['a','b','c'](-3)` will return `'a'`

If X is an out-of-range number, `F X` will return the empty tuple `()`.
If X is not an number, `F X` will throw an error.

**When F is a string and X is a number**, the application `F X` returns the 
character at position X. This works exactly the same as if a string was a
list of characters, except that it returns an empty string in all the cases 
where a list would return an empty tuple.

**When F is a namespace and X is a string**, the application `F X` returns the 
value of `F` mapped to the name `X`. A namespace can therefore be interpreted
as a mapping between names and values.

Examples:
* `{a=1, b=2} "a"` will return `1`
* `{a=1, b=2}("b")` will return `2`

If X is a non-mapped name or not a name at all, `F X` will return the empty 
tuple `()`.


Arithmetic operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The arithmetic operators are sum (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`),
division (`/`), modulo (`%`) and exponentiation (`^`).

#### Arithmetic operations between booleans
* `B1 + B2` returns the logic `or` between `B1` and `B2`
* `B1 * B2` returns the logic `and` between `B1` and `B2`

#### Arithmetic operations between numbers
The arithmetic operations between numbers work as learnt it in primary school:

* `5 + 2` returns `7`
* `5 - 2` returns `3`
* `5 * 2` returns `10`
* `5 / 2` returns `2.5`
* `5 % 2` returns `1`
* `5 ^ 2` returns `25`

#### Arithmetic operations on strings
The string type implements the sum operation between two strings and the product 
between a number and a string.

The sum `s1 + s2` between two strings returns the concatenation of the two 
strings. For example `"abc" + "def"` returns `"abcdef"`.

The product `n * s` between a number `n` and a string `s` is equivalent to 
`s * n` and returns the string `s` repeated `n` times. For example `3 * "Abc"`, 
as well as `"Abc" * 3` returns `"AbcAbcAbc"`.

#### Arithmetic operations on lists
The list type implements the sum operation between two lists and the product 
between a number and a list.

The sum `l1 + l2` between two lists returns the concatenation of the two lists.
For example `[1,2,3] + [4,5,6]` returns `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

The product `n * l` between a number `n` and a list `l` is equivalent to `l * n`
and returns the list `l` repeated `n` times. For example `3 * [1,2,3]`, as well 
as `[1,2,3] * 3` returns `[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]`.

#### Arithmetic operations between namespaces
The namespace type implements only the sum operation.

The sum `ns1 + ns2` between two namespaces returns a new namespace obtained by
merging `ns1` and `ns2`. For example `{a=1,b=2} + {c=3,d=4}` returns 
`{a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4}`.

If `ns1` and `ns2` contain the same name, the value of `ns2` prevails. For
example `{a=1,b=2} + {b=3, c=4}` returns `{a=1, b=3, c=4}`.

#### Arithmetic operations between tuples
The sum of a tuple `t1=(x1,x2,x3)` and a tuple `t2=(y1,y2,y3)` is the tuple
`(x1+y1, x2+y2, x3+y3)`. The same goes for difference, product, division,
modulo and exponentiation.

If the two tuples have different number of items, the missing items are assumed
to be `()`. The empty tuple follows the rules listed below:

* `() + any` equals `any + ()` equals `any`
* `() - any` equals `()`
* `any - ()` equals `any`
* `() * any` equals `any * ()` equals `()`


Comparison operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comparison operations compare two values and return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 
Swan defines the following comparison operators:
* Equal: `==`
* Not equal: `!=` 
* Less than: `<`
* Less than or equal to: `<=`
* Greater than: `>`
* Greater than or equal to: `>=`

#### Comparison operations between booleans
Two booleans are equal if they are both true or both false. Furthermore false
is less than true.

#### Comparison operations between numbers
The comparison between numbers works as expected. For example, the following
expressions resolve to true:

* `10 == 10`
* `10 != 11`
* `10 < 11`
* `10 <= 11`
* `10 <= 10`

#### Comparison operations between strings
Two strings are equal if they contain the same sequence of characters. For
example `"abc" == "abc"` is true.

A string `s1` is less than a string `s2` if `s1` precedes `s2` alphabetically.
For example, the following expressions return true:

* `"abc" < "xyz"`
* `"zzz" > "aaa"`

#### Comparison operations between lists
Two lists are equal if they contain the same sequence of items. For
example `[1,2,3] == [1,2,3]` is true, but `[1,2,3] == [1,2]` is false.

A list `l1` is less than a list `l2` if `l1` precedes `l2` lexicographically.
For example, the following expressions return true:

* `[1,2,3] < [4,5,6]`
* `[1,2,3] < [1,2,4]`
* `[1,3,4] > [1,2,4]`

#### Comparison operations between namespaces
Two namespaces are equal if they contain the same set of name-value pairs.
For example `{a=1,b=2} == {a=1,b=2}` is true, but `{a=1,b=2} == {a=1,b=4,c=5}`
is false.

No order is defined for the namespace type, therefore only the `==` and `!=`
operators will work between namespaces.

#### Comparison operations between functions
Two functions are equal if they are the same function. For example, given two
functions `f1:x->2*x` and `f2:x->2*x`, the expression `f1 == f1` is true, but
the expression `f1 == f2` is false.

No order is defined for the function type, therefore only the `==` and `!=`
operators will work between functions.

#### Comparison operations between tuples
Two tuples are equal if they contain the same sequence of items. For
example `(1,2,3) == (1,2,3)` is true, but `(1,2,3) == (1,2)` is false.

A tuple `t1` is less than a tuple `t2` if `t1` precedes `t2` lexicographically.
For example, the following expressions return true:

* `(1,2,3) < (4,5,6)`
* `(1,2,3) < (1,2,4)`
* `(1,3,4) > (1,2,4)`

If the two tuples have different number of items, the missing items are assumed
to be `()`. The empty tuple is less than anything else and equal only to itself.


Conditional and alternative expression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A conditional expression `C ? V` resolves to the empty tuple `()` if `C` is a 
*false-like* value; otherwise it resolves `V`.

A false-like value is one of `()`, `FALSE`, `0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}` or a tuple 
made only of false-like items.

For example:

* `2 > 1 ? "ok"` resoves to `"ok"`
* `2 < 1 ? "ok"` resoves to `()`
* `"abc" ? "ok"` resoves to `"ok"`
* `"" ? "ok"` resoves to `()`

An alternative expression `A ; B` resolves `A` if it is not an empty tuple;
otherwise it resolves `B`.

For example:

* `() ; 3` resolves `3`
* `10 ; 2` resolves `10`

When combined together, the conditional and the alternative expression work as
an if-else condition:

* `1==1 ? "eq" ; "ne"` resolves to `"eq"`
* `1==2 ? "eq" ; "ne"` resolves to `"ne"`


Logic operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The logic operators AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) generalize the logic AND/OR to any
value type. 

The AND operation `A & B` returns `A` if it is a false-like value, otherwise it
returns `B`.

The OR operation `A | B` returns `A` if it is a true-like value, otherwise it
returns `B`.


Subcontexting operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you assign a value to a name with `name = value`, you are defining that 
name in the global namespace and you can access the associated value as `name` 
in another expression.

When you assign a value to a name between curly braces `{name1=10, name2=20}`,
you are defining names in a sub-namespace and you can access the associated 
values with an apply operation `{a=1}("a")`.

A subcontexting operation `ns . expression` executes the right-hand expression
in a sub-context obtained by extending the parent context with the names 
contained in the namespace `ns`.

For example, `{a=2,b=3}.(a+b)` will resolve to `5`.

The global names are still visible in the righ-hand expression, unless they are
overridden by local namespace names. For example:

```
x = 10,
y = 20,
ns = {x=100, z=300},
sum = ns.(x+y+z)
```

The `sum` name will map to the value `420`. In fact, in the right-hand expression
`x+y+z`, the names `x` and `z` will be found in `ns`, while the name `y` will
not be found in `ns` and will be taken from the global namespace.

The subcontexting can be also used as an alternative way to access names defined
inside a namespace. In the example above, the expression `ns.z` will indeed
resolve to the value of `z` inside the namespace `ns`.


Composition operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The composition operation `g << f` returns the function `x -> g(f x)`.

The reverse composition operation `g >> f` returns the function `x -> f(g x)`.


Operators precedence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless grouping parenthesis are used, the operations are executed in the following
order.

1. application , `.`
2. `^`
3. `*` , `/`, `%`
4. `+` , `-`
5. `==` , `!=` , `<` , `<=` , `>=` , `>`
6. `&` , `|`
7. `?`
8. `;`
9. `->`
10. `=` , `:`
11. `<<`, `>>` 
12. `,`

If the expression contains two or more operators with the same rank, the
leftmost operation gets executed first.

The only exception to this rule is the function creation operation `->`, for 
which the right-most operations get executed first. For example, the 
expression `x -> y -> x+y` is equivalent to `x -> (y -> x+y)`.


Builtin functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following functions are available out-of-the-box.

- `bool x`, converts x to boolean
- `enum x`, returns the tuple of the items contained in x
- `error msg`, throws an error
- `filter f x`, filters the items contained in x that match the test function `f`
- `map f x`, maps x via the mapping function `f`
- `not x`, return `FALSE` if `bool x` is true, otherwise `TRUE`
- `range n`, returns the list of numbers between `0` and `n`
- `reduce f x`, reduces the tuple `x` to a single value via the reducer function `f`
- `require x`, loads a standard library module 
- `size x`, returns the number of items in `x`
- `str x`, converts `x` to a string 
- `type x`, returns the type name of `x`

See the [built-in functions documentation](./builtin-functions.md) for more
details.
